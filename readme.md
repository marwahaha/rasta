A homoiconic dialect of ruby that tries to extend Ruby's incredible runtime flexibility to the abstract syntax tree, so you can change the syntax of the language while your code is running :). You could <i>almost</i> call rasta a lisp, except... you know... lisp's aren't 'cool'...

Although it kind of works, it should still be considered pre-pre-alpha and certainly isn't ready to be used for anything you're ever going to use.
